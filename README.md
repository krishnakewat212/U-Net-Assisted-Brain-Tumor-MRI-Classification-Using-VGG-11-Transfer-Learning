# U-Net–Assisted Spatial Feature Refinement for Interpretable Brain Tumor MRI Classification Using VGG-11 Transfer Learning

## Overview
This repository presents a deep learning–based framework for multi-class brain tumor MRI classification using VGG-11 transfer learning enhanced with spatial feature refinement. The approach improves class-discriminative localization by emphasizing informative convolutional feature maps prior to classification, leading to strong predictive performance and improved interpretability.
The model is evaluated on four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor.
